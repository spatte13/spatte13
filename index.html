        <h2>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why. (WA1)</h2>
        <p1>
        Back in school i was given a choice of; chose a problem, any problem and solve it. I decided to make a game with python using the library pycharm using IDE Pycharm. The game was a pixel 2d based wild west linear shooter, the goal was to get to the end of the mission similar to mario.
        I believe this was designed well as I used object orientated programming, aswell as it ran rather efficently. tips for myself and other coders is to try to recycle code, and refrain from coding the came type of code when possible.

        <h2>Why is software design important? (WA1)</h2>
        <p2>
        Software design is important for your program so it can be efficent, understandable and also creative. As when solving the problem you dont want to create problems within the solution like low performance, lag and bugginess. 
        Aswell as if in a team of more then one, then soft skills is important as this will effect chemistry and communication between the team.

        <h2>What is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important? (WA2)</h2>
        <p2>       
        In the requirements gathering stage of software development, teams work to collect and write down what the software needs to do. This involves talking to people who will use the software, such as customers and stakeholders, to understand their needs and expectations. The team conducts interviews, surveys, and group discussions to gather information. 
        This stage is very important because it sets the groundwork for the whole development process. If the requirements are not clear or complete, it can lead to problems like increased costs, delays, or even project failure. By taking the time to understand and document what users want, teams can create a better product that meets those needs and avoids expensive changes later on.

        <h1>Written Assignment 4 - The Importance Of Communication</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>What is the importance of communication, with personal past experience. (WA4)</h2>
        <p2>       
        Communication is very important in software design because it helps everyone work together effectively. When team members like: developers, designers, and project managers communicate well, they are more likely to understand the project goals and requirements. 
        This understanding reduces mistakes and makes the development process smoother.
        Three key elements of effective communication are: active listening, which builds trust is. Clarity and conciseness, which makes complex ideas easier to understand, and empathy which helps team members appreciate each other’s viewpoints.
        I remember a time during a group project when I didn’t check if my teammates understood the technical requirements. I assumed they did, but this led to confusion and delays. 
        After learning about the importance of clear communication and active listening in class, I realize I could have done better by encouraging my teammates to ask questions and share their thoughts. This would have created a more open environment, helping us work together more effectively and improving our project results.
