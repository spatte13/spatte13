        <p1>
        Back in school i was given a choice of; chose a problem, any problem and solve it. I decided to make a game with python using the library pycharm using IDE Pycharm. The game was a pixel 2d based wild west linear shooter, the goal was to get to the end of the mission similar to mario.
        I believe this was designed well as I used object orientated programming, aswell as it ran rather efficently. tips for myself and other coders is to try to recycle code, and refrain from coding the came type of code when possible.
