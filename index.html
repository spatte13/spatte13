        <h2>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why. (WA1)</h2>
        <p1>
        Back in school i was given a choice of; chose a problem, any problem and solve it. I decided to make a game with python using the library pycharm using IDE Pycharm. The game was a pixel 2d based wild west linear shooter, the goal was to get to the end of the mission similar to mario.
        I believe this was designed well as I used object orientated programming, aswell as it ran rather efficently. tips for myself and other coders is to try to recycle code, and refrain from coding the came type of code when possible.

        <h2>What is happening in the requirements gathering stage and explain why this stage is important? (WA2)</h2>
        <p2>       
        In the requirements gathering stage of software development, teams work to collect and write down what the software needs to do. This involves talking to people who will use the software, such as customers and stakeholders, to understand their needs and expectations. The team conducts interviews, surveys, and group discussions to gather information. 
        This stage is very important because it sets the groundwork for the whole development process. If the requirements are not clear or complete, it can lead to problems like increased costs, delays, or even project failure. By taking the time to understand and document what users want, teams can create a better product that meets those needs and avoids expensive changes later on.
